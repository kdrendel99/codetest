        <p> Ruby is a nice all-in-one package for webdev. It's great to learn for web specifically, however few people use Ruby by itself anymore. So while one could use Ruby as a python replacement, there's more demand elsewhere. If you're interested in web dev and (em)only(/em) webdev, then Ruby is a really marketable language to know. Many companies will use either Dotnet or Ruby on Rails to build their programs.</p>
